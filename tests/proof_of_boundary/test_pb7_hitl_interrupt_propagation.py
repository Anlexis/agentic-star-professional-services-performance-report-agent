# PB-07 — human-in-the-loop interrupt propagation.
#
# This template does not pause for human review: the performance report is
# produced in one pass from the submitted figures, and there is no decision
# inside the workflow a person has to make before it can continue.
#
# "Not applicable" is a claim, though, and a test file that only skips proves
# nothing about whether the claim is still true. So instead of skipping, this
# module PINS the claim from both ends: no node calls interrupt(), and the
# runtime configuration does not enable the checkpointing that resuming would
# require. If either changes, these tests fail and say what to add — the two
# propagation cases, one for the interrupt reaching the engine and one for the
# guard that stops it when the caller does not allow a pause.
